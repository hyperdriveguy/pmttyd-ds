# Progress and next-session handoff

Updated 2026-10-11 (America/Boise). This is a working native development slice,
not a completed remake or fidelity-verified port.

## User decisions

Target New 2DS XL, 60 Hz gameplay/60 fps presentation target; emulator-only
validation for now. Start with an early Rogueport plaza slice and introductory
Crump encounter. Touch-centered menus retain physical button access. The user's
latest correction requires very similar original art and preservation of
original sounds/music. Earlier redrawn sprites and generated tones were removed.

## Implemented

- Reproducible devkitARM/libctru/citro3d/citro2d build, embedded RomFS `.3dsx`.
- Host-testable simulation, fixed ticks, bounded catch-up, input edge consumption,
  original-wall collision, following partner, camera, jumping and paper turns.
- Dialogue, touch and button menus, jump/hammer/guard battle harness, mushroom,
  victory, defeat/retry and return to exploration. Parameters remain provisional.
- Versioned save encoding, validation, temporary-file replacement and backup
  recovery, plus on-screen save failure reporting.
- Read-only inventory of 3,204 ISO files; exact-path extraction and provenance.
- GX tiled/paletted/CMPR texture conversion; original AnimGroup idle-pose baking;
  original Mario full-body idle/jump/hammer textures in a shared atlas.
- Original Rogueport plaza and common battle stage geometry/materials/textures.
  Plaza: 40,714 triangles, 79 batches, 60 textures; 711 near-ground wall segments.
  Stage: about 10,000 triangles, 14 material batches before visibility overrides;
  consult romfs/manifest.json for the final count.
- Original Rogueport, normal-battle and victory music decoded to PCM16 without
  resampling; NDSP streaming with original loop metadata.
- Original MusyX banks preserved and 1,247 samples indexed. Standalone sample
  decoding works; sound-event macro mapping/playback is unfinished.
- Isolated Azahar and Dolphin capture tooling, durable architecture/asset/mechanics
  notes and project instructions. No existing emulator settings/saves modified.

## Validation

`make all` builds ttyd-2ds.3dsx with devkitARM. `make test` passes the portable core
scenario suite and 16 Python codec/extraction/topology tests. Core scenarios cover
movement, collision imports, partner following, dialogue, menu input, action timing
boundaries/mashing, damage, item use, victory, defeat/retry and save recovery.

The isolated Azahar 2126.2 OpenGL/llvmpipe profile booted both screens and reported
60 fps during typical captures. It exercised touch tabs, movement, dialogue,
battle selection, five unsuccessful jump attacks, enemy damage, victory, return
to plaza and save creation. The saved result had Crump defeated and Mario at 6 HP.
Screenshots/logs are under artifacts/azahar. Capture sequence:

```sh
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_walkthrough.py
```

Final verification repeated `make -j2 all` (up to date) and `make test` (core
suite and all 16 Python tests passed). Running
`python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --seconds 4` without resetting the save visibly
restored Mario at 6/10 HP and the completed Crump encounter. The final battle
capture still contains an upper curtain clipping Crump and a central prop despite
the hidden-node overrides: investigate the actual node hierarchy/visibility before
claiming that these overrides resolve presentation. Plaza foreground occlusion
also remains visible in the reload capture.

The input sequence is not a pixel-asserted acceptance test. Review the captures.
Precise action/guard timing and defeat were verified in host tests; their full
emulator acceptance checklist remains below. Occasional capture/save transitions
showed lower emulator frame rates; no sustained performance benchmark or physical
hardware validation has been performed. Do not claim verified hardware 60 fps.

Dolphin successfully booted the original ISO in an isolated profile and captured
its initial health/safety screen. No original gameplay measurements were obtained.

```sh
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --reference-dolphin --seconds 12
```

SDL/X socket creation fails under the restricted sandbox; the isolated virtual
screen checks succeeded with sandbox escalation. No automatic review rejection
occurred. Tools write profiles/captures only beneath project artifacts.

## Immediate next work

1. Finish original sound effects: resolve event IDs through pmario.proj/pool macros
   to the indexed sdir/samp sources, including pitch/envelopes/loops; bind cursor,
   jump, hammer, damage, guard and success events. Do not substitute synthesized
   effects or arbitrarily select bank samples. Start with tools/audio_convert.py,
   local-assets/sample-directory.json and docs/ASSETS.md.
2. Capture actual US GameCube tutorial gameplay in Dolphin. Confirm available
   commands, initial stats, timing windows, damage, guard restrictions, defeat,
   music selection, original dialogue and victory sequence. Replace provisional
   BattleRules and record measured evidence in docs/MECHANICS.md.
3. Implement original character animations and direction variants. The converter
   currently applies passed-keyframe deltas but does not interpolate full original
   animations. Vertex, visibility, texture-matrix and node tracks need full support. Ensure model sizing is correct and faithful.
4. Finish battle presentation: original area backdrop, opening-curtain animation,
   audience, correct prop visibility and camera. The common stage currently uses
   explicit hidden-node overrides for the mask, closed upper curtain and inactive
   switch props; these are inferred defaults, not Dolphin-verified visibility rules.
5. Improve plaza camera/foreground occlusion, original ground/slope/trigger semantics,
   partner navigation around obstacles and collision broad-phase performance.
6. Complete Azahar checks for successful/failed actions and guards, hammer release,
   touch battle selection, healing, defeat/retry and repeated transitions.
   Extend captures with explicit checks rather than treating screenshots as assertions.
7. Profile physical New 2DS XL when available. Optimize/decimate geometry and tune
   texture budgets; add room asset unload/load before expanding story content.

## Build/tool details

- Default ISO: /home/carson/games/roms/G8ME01.iso; override with TTYD_ISO.
- Azahar: /usr/bin/azahar; Dolphin: /usr/bin/dolphin-emu.
- Runtime save: sdmc:/3ds/ttyd-2ds/progress.bin with .bak and temporary .tmp.
- Isolated test save: artifacts/azahar/data/azahar-emu/sdmc/3ds/ttyd-2ds/.
- --fresh-save resets only that generated test save; omit it to check reload.
- Source, generated/extracted assets and emulator profiles remain in the workspace.
  Original/compiled assets are ignored by .gitignore. The read-only .git placeholder
  is not a functional checkout; no commits exist. Do not delete it or claim commits.
- Build-time texture cap is 128px for maps; original source data is retained locally.
  Music keeps original sample rates/channels. Audio service failure is nonfatal.
- Room meshes remain resident and are reused through transitions; true room streaming
  is not implemented. No CIA packaging, full opening, additional chapters, or broad
  partner combat systems yet.

## Story/dialogue requirement update

User requires the original story and original US English dialogue, without
paraphrasing or invented substitute scenes. Recorded in AGENTS.md and README.md.
Removed authored NPC/Crump/Goombella dialogue from the harness; explicit
development notices now mark the missing implementation. Read-only extraction
of msg/US/gor_00.txt, gor_01.txt and global.txt with SHA256 provenance is in
local-assets/messages. Next: parse message IDs/control tokens, connect the
original intro event sequence and branches, and compare playback with Dolphin.
Do not treat merely inserting original lines into the fabricated plaza encounter
as faithful story reproduction. Original message playback is still unfinished.

Validation for this update: `make test` passed the core suite and 16 Python
tests; `make -j2 all` rebuilt the native .3dsx successfully. Emulator dialogue
playback was not rechecked in this update.

## Overworld continuation: original ground and partner traversal

Implemented original near-horizontal collision triangle export as map.ground,
packaged in RomFS. Portable groundAt performs barycentric height queries with
step-height constraints so ramps update actor elevation, missing floors block
movement and roofs cannot pull actors upward. Actor and shadow rendering use
player/partner elevation. Goombella follows a bounded path of Mario's travelled
positions instead of cutting directly toward Mario through obstacles. This is
still provisional: jump traversal, stairs, falling, dynamic geometry and partner
recovery need further work. Walls are still flattened and fixed plaza bounds
remain; collision broad-phase acceleration is not implemented.

Fixed restore when called with the game's own Progress reference. Added host
coverage for slope heights, inaccessible roofs, missing floor, step constraints
and self-reference restore. `make test` passed core scenarios and 16 Python
tests; `make -j2 all` rebuilt the embedded original asset pack and .3dsx.

Read-only extraction of rel/gor.rel and provenance is in local-assets. Indexed
39 original map/bero string occurrences in rogueport-event-strings.json. This
is evidence to resolve original exits, not a complete warp table. There are no
overworld room warps yet. Next concrete task: resolve gor_01 exit/event records
(including REL relocations), original node trigger positions and destination
arrival IDs; add native room asset loading and transactional room transitions,
then test reciprocal warps and save compatibility. Avoid inventing destinations
or treating original string occurrences alone as a verified connection graph.

The workspace now has a functioning git checkout (git log shows bf9fea8). Older
statements about a nonfunctional placeholder describe the earlier environment.

Azahar verification: `python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --seconds 4` booted
the updated build and restored the existing 6 HP completed-encounter save.
Capture reviewed at artifacts/azahar/boot.png; foreground wall occlusion
remains. This boot check does not verify movement, slopes or room transitions.

## Overworld continuation: reciprocal Rogueport roads

Original roads now connect gor_01 plaza to gor_00 harbor, gor_02 east side
and gor_03 west side, in both directions. The asset pipeline parses original
REL self-relocations and BeroEntry records (0x3c bytes), matches contiguous road
tables to original map marker names, and rejects ambiguous/nonreciprocal links.
Geometry markers supply original AUTO-position centers. Native spawn inset .9,
trigger radius .7 and cooldown 45 ticks are provisional adaptation values.
Evidence and original record offsets are in local-assets/room-links.json and
romfs/manifest.json. Original reference layout was inspected at
https://github.com/jdaster64/ttyd-tot/blob/main/ttyd-tools/rel/include/ttyd/evt_bero.h;
no code from that header is compiled or copied into the runtime.

Three additional original rooms and texture packs are converted locally.
Renderer stages a destination room before freeing the previous one, synchronizing
GPU work before disposal. Main loop stages simulation arrival, validates target
collision/floor and swaps rendering before committing progress; failed loads
restore previous collision. Catch-up/input are reset across I/O. Partner follows
after entering, and transitions save the checkpoint. Only plaza shows the
provisional NPC/Crump encounter. Interior doors, pipes, story gates and gor_04
are still unsupported; original cutscenes/door animation/fades are unfinished.

Walls now retain vertical min/max extents (count high bit marks six-float wall
records); elevated harbor platforms are no longer blocked by lower walls.
Save version 2 keeps 32 bytes, using byte26 for room and signed byte27 for
elevation quantized to .1. Version 1 migrates to plaza/elevation0. Structural
decoding is independent of the currently loaded room; loading validates original
target collision/ground. Tests cover legacy decoding, elevation and invalid IDs.

Validation: make test passed core scenarios and 16 Python tests;
`build-host/core_tests --rooms` validated all six arrivals with original room
collision/ground, HP preservation, checkpoint encoding and cooldown. Azahar
asserted saved destination IDs on east/plaza round trip and two harbor/plaza
and two west/plaza round trips. Captures under artifacts/azahar were reviewed.
Room I/O produces transient frame drops; no hardware benchmark. A rendering
regression appears after streaming: some bottom-screen panels become black,
while save feedback remains visible. Additional C2D state reset before the bottom
screen is under verification; do not claim the rendering is fully accepted.

Reproduce isolated road tests:
```sh
python3 tools/road_fixtures.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/east-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_roads.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/harbor-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_roads.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/west-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_roads.py
```

Next: verify/fix Citro2D state after room streaming; expand reciprocal warp
testing to failed loads and restart in each destination. Improve camera Z and
foreground occlusion per original camera/event data. Add collision spatial
indexing and preserve distinct vertical segments sharing X/Z. Resolve original
interior/pipe triggers, conditions, door visibility and animation before expanding
connections. Original dialogue/story playback, sound events, full animation and
hardware validation remain required for the full playable remake.

Final streaming verification: resetting C2D state again before the bottom-screen
scene fixed the black-panel regression. Repeated the east-side test on the final
build (two round trips, saved-room assertions passed); reviewed
road-east-return-1.png with the full status/menu visible at reported 60 fps.
The earlier harbor/west runs predated this C2D-only fix. `make test`,
`build-host/core_tests --rooms` and `git diff --check` all passed again.
`make -j2 all` rebuilt successfully. The next agent should verify harbor/west
bottom-screen presentation and destination restart persistence, then camera and
foreground occlusion. No original story dialogue has been restored yet.

## Overworld continuation: framing, indexed collision and destination reload

Cameras now follow X and Z plus smoothed floor height. The fixed horizontal
clamp and fixed depth target were removed: restored/warped rooms initialize
the camera around the arrival, and exploration follows movement throughout
room depth. Field eye offset (0,4.8,6.5), target (0,1,-1.4), smoothing .07
are adaptation values, not measured original camera rails. Harbor arrival
now centers Mario instead of leaving him at the distant top edge. Foreground
geometry still needs occlusion handling; this does not solve the original
scripted camera system or all visibility problems.

Walls and floor triangles now build a two-unit spatial grid per successful
load. Runtime queries test nearby candidates instead of the entire room.
Coordinates/reference elevations are validated before cell lookup, oversized
indexes are rejected and failed indexing keeps the previously loaded data.
Empty imported wall sets are distinguished from the synthetic host fallback.
Converter deduplication now preserves distinct wall heights sharing X/Z,
fixing accidental replacement of lower/upper walls. Python regression coverage
checks stacked walls. Exported wall/surface counts: plaza 1240/1010, harbor
748/463, east 1555/878, west 1509/1037.

The touchscreen map now scales each room's original collision footprint into
its panel, filters walls to Mario's elevation, and displays Mario/Goombella
markers. It no longer assumes plaza bounds or shows Crump in other rooms.
Field labels use readable area names instead of internal pack filenames.

Verification:
- make test: portable core scenarios and 17 Python tests passed.
- build-host/core_tests --rooms: all six original-data arrivals passed;
  14,652 indexed collision/floor probes across four rooms matched exhaustive
  scans at multiple elevations, including cell boundaries.
- make -j2 all: original packs and native .3dsx rebuilt successfully.
- Harbor road sequence completed two round trips on the new camera/indexed
  build, with saved-room assertions. Reviewed harbor arrival capture: centered
  Mario, complete touch menu, reported 60 fps.
- West destination persistence sequence asserted room0 -> room3, HP7, exited;
  a second emulator launch without fixture/reset asserted room3 -> room0, HP7.
  This verifies destination restore through an actual usable return warp.
  Touch map capture reviewed in west room: original footprint and markers fit
  its panel. Bottom-screen menu remains visible after streaming.

Persistence reproduction (isolated test profile only):
```sh
python3 tools/road_fixtures.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/west-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_persistence.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_persistence.py
```

Next concrete work: foreground occlusion / original scene visibility and
original camera/event data; destination restart checks for harbor elevation
and east room, failed-load recovery and broader room traversal. Resolve gor_04
and original interior/pipe triggers and story conditions before enabling them.
Native door/pipe animations, original dialogue/event sequencing, character
animation, SFX and hardware profiling remain incomplete. No full-remake or
hardware 60 fps acceptance claim is made.

## Character proportion correction

User reported characters very large relative to original maps. Applied one
shared .5 visual scale to character billboard height/width and matching shadow
footprints in field and battle. Map geometry, camera framing, source texture
resolution, actor positions and collision are unchanged. Relative character
proportions are preserved. This is an explicit visual calibration in response
to feedback, not a measured original actor-instance scale. Original AnimGroup
pose bounds alone do not prove game-instance sizing; compare the actual US
GameCube actors/doorways in Dolphin before claiming exact fidelity.

Validation: `make -j2 all`, `make test` (core + 17 Python tests), and
`git diff --check` passed. `python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --seconds 4`
booted; reviewed artifacts/azahar/boot.png showing Mario smaller beside the
original plaza building/doorway. Battle sizing uses the same factor but was
not separately captured in this update.

## Overworld continuation: atomic collision rollback and saved-room recovery

Room collision now stages through an RAII CollisionTransition. Previous walls,
vertical intervals, floors, spatial indexes and map bounds stay in memory until
destination collision, arrival and rendering have all succeeded. Failed staging
or rejected arrival/rendering restores the old data without filesystem access.
Native warp failure no longer attempts an unchecked disk reload of the source
room. Startup save restoration also stages collision, rejects unavailable
positions coherently, initializes the default plaza camera/floor and shows an
explicit notice. Renderer synchronizes GPU work before disposing partial loads
on failure as well as before replacing a successfully loaded room.

Host tests cover truncated destination ground, previous room files removed
before rollback, failed commit, rejected staged arrival/graphics analogue, nested
rollback, bounds preservation, spatial-query restoration and successful commit.
`make test` passed core scenarios and 17 Python tests.
`build-host/core_tests --rooms` passed all six arrivals and 14,652 indexed-vs-full
scan probes. `make -j2 all` rebuilt the .3dsx; `git diff --check` passed.

Azahar persistence runs confirmed plaza -> harbor and restart harbor -> plaza
with HP7 preserved, exercising the elevated arrival. East-side persistence
confirmed plaza -> east with HP7; restart verification follows. Existing west
restart evidence remains in the preceding entry. No physical hardware tested.

Invalid-room fixture uses a structurally valid room1 save at (50,50), outside
its floor. Azahar displayed the fallback notice in a coherent plaza scene;
the script then moved Mario and saved, asserting room0, default HP10 and
expected plaza coordinates. Capture invalid-room-fallback.png was reviewed.
This verifies invalid-arrival recovery; it is not a native injected texture-load
failure test. Foreground wall occlusion is still visible in the plaza capture.

Reproduce saved-room / recovery checks using only isolated test profiles:
```sh
python3 tools/road_fixtures.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/harbor-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_persistence.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_persistence.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/east-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_persistence.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_persistence.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/invalid-room-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_invalid_room.py
```

Next concrete task: foreground wall/prop occlusion and original visibility
rules, because Mario can still be obscured at normal plaza positions. Then
original door/pipe event triggers and room conditions (gor_04 and interiors),
original English story/dialogue, character animation and original SFX. Preserve
the shared .5 character correction from user feedback; original actor sizing
still needs Dolphin measurement. Successful outdoor warps are not proof of
full story, world rendering or gameplay acceptance. Goal remains active.

Final persistence result: restarted east room -> plaza with HP7 preserved.
Both harbor and east restart tests completed on this transaction build. The
final native rebuild includes GPU synchronization before partial-load cleanup;
normal east persistence succeeded afterward. No GPU failure was deliberately
injected. All reported source changes and reproducible fixture scripts are
recorded in the incremental commit for this update.

## Overworld continuation: exterior-wall cutaways

Implemented rendering cutaways for original exterior-wall S_gai_kabe scene
subtrees. Walls keep their original geometry/materials/textures; the converter
separates wall owners into batches, including inherited nested drawable pieces.
Runtime builds bounding boxes, probes camera-to-Mario foot/head and Goombella
body segments against original triangles, and skips only obstructing wall
groups. Eight simulation ticks of hold reduce toggling when a probe leaves an
edge. Ground, buildings, other props and collision are not removed by this
mechanism. Battle uses its normal room rendering. This is a handheld visibility
adaptation, not a measured reconstruction of original event-controlled cutaways.
Some caps or decorative pieces in separate original nodes may still require
original visibility rules; interior roofs/props are outside this classification.

Final packs retain original triangle counts: plaza 40,714, harbor 22,922,
east 33,444, west 34,885. Batch counts are now 104/78/98/115, with
26/6/14/13 tagged wall groups respectively. Data is recorded in manifest.json.
New portable visibility helpers use finite, two-sided segment/triangle tests
and slab bounds tests. Core scenarios cover winding, misses, behind-camera or
beyond-actor geometry, endpoint contact, parallel/degenerate triangles and
invalid bounds/NaNs. `make test` passed core scenarios and 17 Python tests;
`build-host/core_tests --rooms` passed six arrivals and 14,652 collision probes.
`make -j2 all` rebuilt the packs and native .3dsx.

Azahar fresh plaza boot was reviewed: Mario visible at the default position
previously obscured by the front wall, while nonblocking walls remain. Field
visibility sequence captured start, front movement, jump, left and rear movement;
reviewed front capture with Mario and partner visible and reported 60 fps.
Those movement captures are manual visual evidence, not pixel assertions.
The full existing encounter harness sequence reached victory at HP6 and returned
to the plaza; reviewed battle-select and battle-turn-5 captures at the corrected
shared character scale. West road script completed two reciprocal round trips,
asserting saved room IDs and exercising cutaway metadata after room streaming.
No hardware benchmark or original-story/mechanics acceptance claim.

Removed the leftover authored victory narrative line (plaza safe) in favor of
an explicit development-encounter notice. Partner display is a neutral status
label. Battle/victory/defeat now consistently display the battle-stage label.
Original English dialogue playback and story sequencing remain unfinished.

Reproduce:
```sh
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_visibility.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_walkthrough.py
python3 tools/road_fixtures.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/west-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_roads.py
```

Next: reproduce original map initialization visibility from REL event records
(including apparent helper/trigger geometry now visible near front openings),
original camera rails, and doors/pipes with their event conditions. Map helper
geometry should not be broadly hidden based only on appearance. Resolve gor_04
and interior links from original records; retain atomic room acceptance.
Original character animations, SFX, English dialogue/story, battle observations
and physical hardware acceptance are still required. The full goal remains active.

## Overworld continuation: original station road

Packaged original gor_04 station geometry/textures/collision and enabled the
original reciprocal west n_bero / station s_bero road. Five rooms now have eight
directed roads. Global distinct-table/reciprocity matching replaces ambiguous
per-room marker-subset selection: station contains an extra north marker, which
must not be confused with harbor's table. Station event/train travel is not
implemented. Preserved room IDs 0–3; new ID4 supports save v2 with registry-based
validation and a host save roundtrip test. Invalid ID5 remains rejected.

Found and corrected marker-midpoint arrival elevation: station s_bero spans
Y0–2, so its midpoint caused ground validation failure. Arrival uses original
marker base height; all eight destinations now pass ground/collision acceptance.
`make test`: core suite and 17 Python tests passed. `make -j2 all` passed.
`build-host/core_tests --rooms`: 18,315 indexed/full-scan collision probes and
eight original room arrivals passed. Azahar station road script completed two
round trips with saved room IDs asserted and HP7 preserved. Reviewed
road-station-arrival-0.png: station art and Mario entrance visible, emulator
reported 60 fps. Train components/static scene show rendering/visibility issues;
this is not original event-state or hardware acceptance. Initial midpoint build
failed both host arrival and native station entry; corrected build passed.

Reproduce:
```sh
python3 tools/road_fixtures.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/station-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_roads.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_roads.py
```
First script also leaves a station checkpoint for restart; second detects room4
and exercises station->west->station. Restart result is recorded below when
verified. Next: original station train/map event visibility and original camera
behavior; doors/pipes/interior connections with event conditions; original
English story/message playback, full character animation and original SFX.
The full playable-game objective remains active.

Restart verification completed: updated station script left room 4/HP 7 checkpoint;
second invocation without fixture or save reset loaded station, completed two
station->west->station round trips and exited with room 4/HP 7 saved. Both scripts
returned exit0. Physical hardware, train travel, story conditions and original
station event/visibility fidelity remain unverified.

## Overworld continuation: original mesh sidedness

Converted original per-node GX face-culling settings into batch metadata.
Original drawable nodes use back culling or no culling in the packaged rooms;
front culling remains supported by the format. Materials now split by sidedness
as well as cutaway group; unchanged triangles/collision, modestly more batches.
Metadata packs original layer in low byte, group in bits8–23 and cull index in
bits24–25. Runtime masks fields separately, rejects unknown high bits and resets
culling for paper actors/2D rendering. Null draw-mode pointers on hierarchy-only
world_root nodes are valid (initial strict pointer reading rejected them).

First direct GX/PICA enum mapping removed plaza floor; inspected Azahar capture
and reversed enum mapping for current view transform. Corrected plaza boot
shows original ground/building fronts, and the moving/jumping cutaway capture
sequence completed. Station script completed two round trips plus station save
on corrected build, asserting room IDs. Reviewed station entrance image: static
train geometry still has malformed/black components; sidedness does not fix
original animation/event state, which remains next fidelity work.

Some Xvfb screenshots contain partial black areas in bottom UI. Temporary
command-buffer probe measured 0.1992 usage, ruling out exhaustion in that plaza
case; diagnostic code was removed before final build. Fresh boot capture showed
full bottom UI. A separate isolated station run forcing Qt window resize/repaint
showed restored menu tabs/status; resize clipped the lower screen in the fixed
1000x800 capture surface. Evidence points to virtual-display repaint/capture
behavior, but no broad menu-rendering acceptance claim is made from partial
captures. Do not silently ignore future reproducible native UI failures.

`make test` passed core and 18 Python tests (batch field isolation and invalid
metadata boundaries added). `make -j2 all` passed;
`build-host/core_tests --rooms` passed all eight arrivals and 18,315 probes.
Reproduce corrected field/station checks with the existing visibility and road
commands above. Battle-stage verification result follows below.
Next: original train/map event visibility and animations, original camera rails,
door/pipe and interior event links, original English message/story playback, SFX
and measured mechanics. Hardware acceptance still unavailable; goal active.

Final battle check: existing walkthrough returned exit0, reached victory at HP6
and returned/saved plaza. Reviewed battle-select and battle-turn-5 captures: stage
floor and curtains retain visible faces, bottom command/result menu fully drawn,
reported 60fps. Goombella remains partly behind the left curtain, and stage props
are still static; original scene presentation remains incomplete. No hardware
performance or observed-original-mechanics claim. Final code contains no temporary
command-buffer probe.

## Overworld continuation: original map mesh animation extraction

Added bounds/count/finite-validated original map mesh animation reader and
Hermite/step frame sampler. Conversion writes original mesh tracks into ignored
local JSON sidecars, records inventories in manifest, and accepts explicit
--animation/--frame visual previews. Original translation/rotation offsets and
scale dividers are respected; hierarchy bind*delta transform order follows
existing format reference. Collision remains static in previews; runtime packs
remain at bind pose. Original event activation, loop modes and playback are not
invented. Material animation table offsets are inventoried, not decoded.

Evidence changes the next station task: gor_04 mesh animation table contains
shadanki and n_1_door_open/close, with remaining entries having no mesh tracks.
There is no train-body mesh track in this table; the malformed/black locomotive
needs original material/scene/event inspection rather than an assumed idle clip.
The door clip targets node tobira. Sampling frames 0/23 changes exactly 702
vertices; UV/colors, batches, collision wall and ground files remain identical.
54 finite original samples across 18 tracks in all five maps and battle stage
passed `python3 tools/verify_map_animations.py`. Duplicate harbor fune_b names
are preserved and name-based preview rejects ambiguous selection.

`make test` passed core plus 20 Python tests, including real-layout synthetic
parser fixtures, truncation/count/nonfinite/step/divisor rejection, clamp behavior
and interpolation. `build-host/core_tests --rooms` passed 18,315 collision probes
and all 8 original arrivals. Native build result recorded below on completion.
No runtime animation/emulator/hardware acceptance claim for this offline step.

Reproduce original asset validation after `make all`:
```sh
python3 tools/verify_map_animations.py
python3 tools/map_convert.py local-assets/gor_04.d /tmp/ttyd-door-open --animation n_1_door_open --frame 23
```
Next concrete tasks: export original node hierarchy/vertex bindings for runtime
mesh playback; decode material animation tracks; recover REL door/event
selection and collision/visibility rules before enabling transitions. Inspect
train material modes, source vertex colors and node transforms to explain the
remaining locomotive defects. Continue English dialogue/story, original SFX
and measured combat; full playable objective remains active.

Final `make -j2 all` completed successfully with animation extraction included in
the asset fingerprint. No runtime mesh playback has been enabled by this change.

## Overworld continuation: material tracks and original init-call evidence

Implemented original material animation decoding and explicit offline UV frame
previews, sharing static/animated texture matrix math. Supported texgen0 material
binding with original names and _v/_x aliases; higher texgens produce a limitation
record. East mizu animation contains both texgen0 and1 tracks on lambert119, so
full water fidelity still requires second-layer rendering. Runtime animation
selection/rates/loop semantics remain unfinished. No default scene animations
were guessed or automatically activated.

`make test` passed core plus 21 Python tests: original-layout material fixture,
invalid texgen rejection, independent S/T scale interpolation and matrix/finite
boundaries. `make -j2 all` passed. `build-host/core_tests --rooms` passed all 8
arrivals and 18,315 collision probes. `python3 tools/verify_map_animations.py` passed
63 material samples across 21 tracks plus 54 mesh samples. East water midpoint
changes 135 UV vertices; west neon_01 midpoint changes 2,010; geometry/colors,
collision and batches remain identical. Existing 702-vertex station door sample
also passed. No new emulator or hardware animation acceptance claim.

Added independent read-only map event inventory, using publicly available
jdaster64/ttyd-utils US symbol CSV (external, ignored). Original REL event headers
provide argc/opcode; full command order/operands/relocation provenance retained,
no script interpreter or branch evaluation. Inventoried gor init scripts: harbor
starts nami/nami_02/hiki_nami; plaza hae; east mizu/noname/ie_01_light; west mizu.
These calls do not alone prove unconditional activation. Station init has
evt_mapobj_flag_onoff at 0x6073c with operands (1,0,train_2,2), and S_bero at 0x6051c
with (1,0,S_bero,2). Determine flag semantics and enclosing conditions before using
these as rendering defaults. This is concrete evidence for the remaining train
visibility issue, rather than assuming an absent train mesh clip.

Reproduce after obtaining external public US symbol CSV:
```sh
python3 tools/map_event_inventory.py --symbols artifacts/reference/us_symbols.csv --output local-assets/map-init-events.json
python3 tools/verify_map_animations.py
python3 tools/map_convert.py local-assets/gor_02.d /tmp/ttyd-water --animation mizu --frame 499.5
```
Next: interpret original map flag/animation-call semantics and branch conditions;
export runtime node/material bindings, enable proven ambient tracks, and repair
train scene visibility. Continue original camera/door/pipe/interior events and
English story/dialogue, SFX and measured combat. Full playable objective active.

## Overworld continuation: source-derived station visibility

Added read-only DOL function inspection with external US symbols and llvm-objdump
to resolve map visibility semantics from actual original bytes. Original
evt_mapobj_flag_onoff 0x80038468: selector0 chooses object flags, selector1 group
flags; onoff0 calls Off, nonzero On. mapGrpFlagOff 0x8001ecb8 calls mapFlgOff
0x8001eee8 recursively over group descendants, leaving owner siblings alone.
mapDisp 0x80024b08 skips nodes with bit0x4000, or flag 0x1 without flag 0x80.
Bit2 gates clipping calculations at 0x80024c54; when clear, branch to0x8002510c
still reaches rendering. Therefore train_2's unconditional bit2 clear is NOT
a hide instruction. Earlier possible train-visibility interpretation is ruled
out; do not suppress train_2 based on that call.

Verified opcode identities against primary evt_cmd.h: 12 IF_STR_EQUAL,32 ELSE,
33 END_IF. Original station init branch 0x604d0 compares entername with
hikousen_return; ELSE 0x604e4 sets group hidden flag 0x1 on gondora_2/hako_1.
Current station road arrives s_bero, so this branch applies. Implemented those
original visibility defaults for the packaged ordinary-road slice. Converter
now suppresses descendants: both group owners have zero own parts, so prior
leaf-only hiding could not implement this rule. Station now 41,084 triangles
(314 fewer), 54 batches; collision and texture inventory unchanged. Remaining
locomotive appearance has not been corrected by this rule or compared with
Dolphin station footage; original camera/lighting/transforms still need evidence.

`make test` passed core plus 21 Python tests; `make -j2 all` passed.
`python3 tools/verify_map_visibility.py` passed exact 314-triangle descendant
suppression and unchanged collision/textures. `build-host/core_tests --rooms`
passed all 8 arrivals and 18,315 collision probes. Original animation verifier
still passes 63 material/54 mesh samples and door/water/neon previews.
Azahar station road result recorded below after terminal completion.

Reproduce source inspection (requires ignored public US symbol CSV):
```sh
python3 tools/inspect_dol_function.py evt_mapobj_flag_onoff --symbols artifacts/reference/us_symbols.csv --output artifacts/reference/evt-map-flags.elf
python3 tools/inspect_dol_function.py mapGrpFlagOff --symbols artifacts/reference/us_symbols.csv --output artifacts/reference/group-flags.elf
python3 tools/inspect_dol_function.py mapDisp --symbols artifacts/reference/us_symbols.csv --output artifacts/reference/map-display.elf
python3 tools/verify_map_visibility.py
```
Primary opcode reference:
https://github.com/jdaster64/ttyd-tot/blob/main/ttyd-tools/rel/include/evt_cmd.h
No original/DOL/decomp executable implementation imported into runtime.
Next: preserve runtime scene nodes and bindings, prove ambient-animation
activation/loop semantics, original camera framing, and expand door/pipe/interior
event conditions. Build-time station subset must be replaced with dynamic
visibility when implementing hikousen_return. Original story/English messages,
SFX, measured combat and hardware acceptance remain incomplete; full goal active.

Final native check: station road script returned exit0, completed two reciprocal
round trips and final station entry; saved room 4/HP 7 verified. Reviewed
road-station-arrival-0.png: Mario entrance and full bottom status menu visible,
reported 60 fps. No claim that the remaining locomotive appearance or original
station story/event behavior is accepted.

## Overworld continuation: native original east material playback

Enabled native texture-zero playback for original east init's mizu/noname/
ie_01_light clips. Verified init call offsets 0x4d694/0x4d6a8/0x4d6bc are outside
conditional blocks. Inspected original US DOL evt_map_playanim, mapPlayAnimationLv,
mapMain and marioStInit: mode1 loops full duration; clock0; default speed1;
elapsed-ms frame calculation uses framerate field initialized 60 for NTSC
(VIGetTvFormat0), 50 otherwise. Upstream viewer duration-1 loop shortcut is NOT
used. Port follows fixed60Hz simulation ticks and resets epoch on room load.
This does not implement original pause/clock behavior during broader story events.

Original Hermite/step matrices baked per integer frame with original raw-UV
bindings. New portable UVAN loader rejects invalid format/version/counts,
nonfinite matrix/UVs, out-of-range/duplicate indices and trailing bytes; output
remains unchanged on failure. Native updates 369 vertices, flushes contiguous
cache ranges and streams/disposes animation metadata with rooms. East file
41,856 bytes; durations999/159/400. All rooms/stage have mandatory valid files,
empty where no proven material-only clip is enabled. Texture-zero east water
is animated; original texgen1 water layer remains missing. No mesh clip enabled
partially: ambient exporter rejects selected clips with mesh tracks.

`make test` passed core plus 21 Python tests. Core now tests UV coordinate
transforms, full-duration loop boundary, invalid-file atomic recovery.
`build-host/core_tests --rooms` passed original all 8 arrivals, 18,315 collision
probes, all room UV metadata imports and three east track loop probes.
Original animation/visibility verifier scripts passed. Native build passed
without warnings after correcting an initial indentation warning.

Azahar existing east road script completed two reciprocal round trips with
saved room IDs asserted. New stationary ambient capture script completed
east entry, movement away from marker, three captures at 1.5 s spacing and return
to plaza. Reviewed east-ambient-180: field/status render and reported 60fps,
sim 0.17/CPU 3.9/GPU 0.5 ms displayed. Transition capture temporarily reported 20fps;
steady capture reported 60. Partial black repaint artifacts persist in some
virtual-display screenshots; no pixel assertion or Dolphin side-by-side visual
acceptance claim. Native runtime update logic/asset imports are verified, but
original complete material appearance and hardware performance remain unproven.

Reproduce:
```sh
make test
make -j2 all
build-host/core_tests --rooms
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/east-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_ambient.py
```
Next: preserve runtime scene nodes for original mesh tracks (harbor water/boat,
plaza hae, west mizu), implement second-layer material rendering, original camera
framing and event visibility. Door/pipe/interior event links, original English
story/dialogue, SFX and measured combat remain necessary. Full goal active.

## Character size correction

Reduced the shared paper character scale from 0.5 to 0.35 following the
reported oversized characters. Heights, widths, paper tilt and shadows are now
30% smaller across field and battle; original map geometry remains at its
existing scale. This is a visual calibration, not measured original actor size.

Validation: `make test` passed core and 21 Python tests; `make -j2 all` built
`ttyd-2ds.3dsx`. `python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --seconds 4`
exited successfully. Reviewed `artifacts/azahar/boot.png`: smaller field actors,
full dual-screen UI, reported 60 fps. Hardware performance is unverified.
Next: compare character proportions and camera framing against Dolphin.
Existing unfinished ambient-animation edits remain in the worktree separately.

## Native plaza and harbor ambient animation; harbor retreat fix

Completed the prior worktree's MSAN mesh animation path. Plaza original hae
animates12 vertices across2 owners (399 frames). Harbor original nami animates
4,581 vertices across3 owners (979 frames), alongside nami/nami_02/hiki_nami
texture-zero material playback (4 tracks,5,451 UV vertices). Original ancestry
is retained during conversion and world delta matrices are baked at integer
frames; native mesh/UV updates share the original full-duration loop epoch.
No cumulative transform drift; mandatory empty headers packaged for unused
rooms/stage. Matrices selected once per track before bound-vertex updates.

Native harbor verification initially FAILED return-to-plaza after walking away
from the marker. Host reproduction proved Mario could change from the entrance
floor to a lower surface inside a wall, then could not retreat. Walking now
checks collision at sampled destination elevation as well as previous elevation.
Added original entrance regression:60 ticks toward harbor, each position stays
walkable, then retreat requests the plaza warp within120 ticks. Map collision
data is unchanged. This does not establish complete staircase/prop semantics;
center harbor entrance is obstructed by original posts and railing.

Verified commands:
```sh
python3 tools/verify_mesh_animation.py
make test
build-host/core_tests --rooms
make -j2 all
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/harbor-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_mesh.py
```
Mesh verifier passed five original poses per room (plaza0/1/27/155/398;
harbor0/1/155/400/978), unchanged collision and batch files. Core plus21 Python
tests passed; original room checks passed all8 arrivals and18,315 indexed vs
full-scan collision probes, actual vertex-count animation bounds, loop checks
and new harbor retreat regression. Native build passed. Final harbor script
passed entry/HP7/three stationary captures/return-to-plaza assertions after fix.
Reviewed harbor-mesh-240: full status UI, reported60fps, sim0.20/CPU5.2/GPU0.5ms.
The current entrance camera obscures the dock/waves; these captures do not prove
visual wave fidelity. Original sampled mesh math and native loading are verified.

Limits: second texture layers and nami/fune_b_lambert83 missing visible material
binding remain recorded in manifests. No conditional boat animation, animated
collision, dynamic visibility or original event/pause behavior added. Physical
hardware and full original presentation remain unverified.
Next concrete task: original harbor traversable floor/wall attributes and camera
framing, then second-layer materials. Continue original English dialogue/story
playback, SFX, measured combat, doors/pipes/interiors; full objective remains active.

Additional final native road checks passed two reciprocal round trips each for
east, west and station, with saved room assertions. Station script also entered
the station for its final checkpoint. `python3 tools/verify_map_visibility.py`
passed original road-entry314-triangle omission/collision/texture invariants.
Reproduce:
```sh
python3 tools/verify_map_visibility.py
for route in east west station; do
  python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture "artifacts/fixtures/$route-road.bin" --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_roads.py
done
```

Final `python3 tools/verify_map_animations.py` passed63 material/54 mesh
finite samples,702 moved station door vertices and prior east/west UV probes.
Final `python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --seconds 4 --input-script
tests/azahar_walkthrough.py` completed the development battle sequence and
return. Reviewed return-plaza.png: smaller actors/full status UI; saved32-byte
checkpoint has room0/HP6/victory flag1. This validates stage resource loading and
return flow, not original battle mechanics or story acceptance.

## Harbor staircase traversal

Investigated original harbor geometry instead of deleting collision or moving
the warp. The entrance stairs have0.1-unit risers. Existing ground sampling
accepted0.25-unit ascent but wall clearance used0.1, so an actor's projected
footprint collided with nearby risers during descent. Unified both through
`StepHeight=0.25` and retained source geometry. This is a provisional native
allowance, NOT a Dolphin-measured original rule. Partner destination elevation
now also receives collision validation, as Mario's does.

Host regression follows the original right-hand staircase, crosses onto the
solid central dock floor at y0.15, checks Mario/partner positions stay walkable
and both reach that height, then retraces stairs and requests the plaza warp.
Additional synthetic collision cases ensure0.1 risers clear,0.3 obstacles block
and overhead walls do not block floor movement. All8 road arrival tests and
18,315 indexed/full-scan collision probes pass under the new clearance.

Initial traversal probe continued into water-side surfaces at x5.6/z2.4/y-0.1;
that did NOT prove solid dock traversal. Revised accepted route stays on the
solid dock, with native saved elevation0.2 (quantized original y0.15) asserted.
Water/fall/recovery behavior remains unfinished: raw original A_mizu collision
flags are0x200 at node drawmode+8, A_mizu_kabe0x5. These values were read from
the user's m/gor_00/d; their runtime semantics have NOT been recovered. Do not
infer universal hazard semantics from names or the unrelated0x40000000 viewer
flag. hitGetAttr/hitCheckAttr and Mario motion in original DOL are next evidence
sources. Current floor packs still lack original per-node attributes.

Validation (all exited0):
```sh
make test
build-host/core_tests --rooms
make -j2 all
python3 tools/road_fixtures.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/harbor-arrival-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_harbor_stairs.py
python3 tools/emulator_smoke.py --fresh-save --save-fixture artifacts/fixtures/station-road.bin --seconds 4 --input-script tests/azahar_roads.py
```
Core plus21 Python tests passed. Native harbor script asserted solid dock
position/elevation/HP7, captured three stationary frames, and returned to plaza.
Station passed two reciprocal round trips and final station checkpoint. Reviewed
final harbor-dock-240: full menu, reported60fps; sim0.23/CPU5.1/GPU0.5ms.
Boat geometry obscures Mario at this central camera position; no original-camera
or complete harbor visual acceptance claim. Hardware remains unverified.

Next concrete task: retain original collision-node attributes with geometry and
recover water/fall recovery semantics, then original harbor camera/framing and
boat visibility/second-layer materials. Original English dialogue/story events,
SFX, broader traversal/doors/pipes, and measured combat remain incomplete.
